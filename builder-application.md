# The Builder Rank

### Application
In order to receive the Builder rank, you first have to go through the three steps of the application process. The first one, the assessment on Discord, involves providing information about yourself as well as showing what you've built in the past.
The information I need to know is as follows (just direct messaging me (Worldbuilder777#6131) on Discord is sufficient):
- Your Age
- Your Ingame Name
- Your Time Zone
- Knowledge of the Worldedit/Multiverse Plugins (yes/no)

After that, you will send me (Worldbuilder777#6131) some screenshots from past builds you made and based on that, the decision is made if you can participate in the next step to the application, an evaluation phase. There, you build a minigame map of your choice, without gaining any rank for the moment, in order to prevent too easy access to staff commands. Once we've decided based on those builds that you may be fit for the staff team, you will be allowed to enter the staff team as a Junior, meaning, we will assess how well you fit into the staff team and if you show the right behaviour for it.

### Evaluation Phase
If you accept our terms, you will be granted access to the Testbuild/Evaluation server which you can reach by typing `/testbuild`. There, you will have as much time as you want to build a map and show your expertise as a builder. Finding your own theme shows me that you have creative thought and don't need supervision to build. To create your own map, do `/create <name>`. However, be warned that you may be wasting your time if we afterwards decide that your map isn't good enough. The map should preferrably be for one of the gamemodes we offer on the server, so if you have any questions to the requirements for those maps, message me (Worldbuilder777#6131) on Discord. We will judge the build based on the following categories:
- Structure
- Terraforming
- Detail
- Creativity
- Usage of Advanced Techniques/Plugins

If you think you're done, message me on Discord, including the name you gave your map.

### What makes a good Minigame map?
The aesthetic is only one aspect of being Builder on a minigames server, the maps ought to be easily playable as well. For that, it is recommended to build rather flat surfaces to play on and not using ice as a floor. Furthermore, in games such as BedWars where you can place blocks, flowers, slabs, stairs and fences are all hindering the easy placement of blocks. Similarly, in modes where you can place blocks, you shouldn't worldedit in structures that can be destroyed by blockupdating them. Also, tall flowers/tall grass is annoying in almost any PvP circumstance since you can't hit through it. Lastly, large amounts of stained glass, as used in a fog effect maybe can make weaker PC setups have framedrops.

### Commands (Evaluation Phase)
- `/testbuild` - Hop on the evaluation build server
- `/create <name>` - Create a world - please use this and not /mv create
- `/mv list` - Shows all the worlds we have on the server
- `/mvtp <name>` - Tp to a certain world
- Worldedit and Voxelsniper commands should be self-explanatory, if not, here's some help for both:
  - [WorldEdit](https://minecraft-worldedit.fandom.com/wiki/Worldedit_Commands)
  - [VoxelSniper](https://westeroscraft.fandom.com/wiki/VoxelSniper_Basics)
  - [Here](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/minecraft_gamepedia/8/8c/DataValuesBeta.png?version=7333f5c44a3eb559e6f9aa61b31bf765) are the data values of all existing blocks (if you want to use mushroom blocks that aren't in the creative inventory for example)

### Duties of a Builder
Being in the staff team also brings a lot of responsibilities with you. We expect our staff members to act responsibly and maturely. Furthermore, as the rank implies, you should be working on maps, although we don't require you to be online consistently and there is no real work output we're aiming for, however, it will become apparent quite quickly whether you're actually involved in the server or just wanted to have a rank. On the other hand, your job is not Moderating, i.e. banning and muting players for misbehaviour, you don't have access to these commands since we separate the Building and Moderation fields.

### Privileges of a Builder
A Builder counts as a staff member and thus can attend team meetings and decide on matters regarding the server. Furthermore, certain perks such as coin boosters, the ability to join full servers and the Ingame and Discord team chat will be available to you.
